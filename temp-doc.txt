5.1. Can you explain the copy (cp ../temp-* .) command used above?

The command tells the system to copy (cp) all files from the parent directory (../) whose name starts with temp- by using the asterisk character (temp-*) to the current directory (.).

5.2. Can you explain why, in this case, we did not have to do git init?

It is a git clone so by default, it is already a fully initialized Git repository.

5.3. Can you commit the files copied? What do you need to do? Execute the commands that are needed.

Yes we can commit the files copied. We just need to do the following:

First, we need to stage the copied files by using the git add command.
$ git add temp-data.csv
$ git add temp-average.csv
$ git add temp-doc.txt

Second, we will use the git commit command to commit the files with the message (-m) "initial commit". 

$ git commit * -m "initial commit"
